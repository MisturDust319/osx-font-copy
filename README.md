# osx-font-copy
A BASH script that finds and copies the font files of an OSX computer into the current directory. Each common font format (OpenType, TrueType, and PostScript) is given a dedicated folder. All stragglers are left in the current directory.

This is meant to copy to a USB stick, hence the "current directory". It seemed easier to just trust the user to run it from the current directory rather than trying to come up with a way to guess where the USB has been mounted.

This really was just a quick and dirty way to compile fonts from the more obvious font directories on an OSX computer. There are more thorough methods to get all the fonts, however, they were beyond my needs.

So, with all that said, if you really find a use for this rather niche BASH Script, cool!

With love,
